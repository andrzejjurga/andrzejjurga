#Hello there!

##About me!

My name is Andrzej Jurga. I love to create, and programming has opened the way for me to use the computer to explore the world. I started with C++ because it was the easiest way to find the materials to learn it. I am happy with this choice because it gave me a solid foundation for further development. Currently I'm mainly working on projects that I'll impose on myself. The effects of my work on some of them can be seen on my GitHub.
